Digital Land Frontend
=====================

Digital Land Frontend contains the code used to build user interfaces for the projects that MHCLG's digital land team are working on.

It builds on the [GOVUK Design System](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk-frontend) code, making the majority of it work with Flask applications.
